The meaning of NLP
NLP is a polysemic term, mainly with the following meanings:

Natural Language Processing (Subfield of AI): Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an important field within computer science and artificial intelligence. It focuses on studying various theories and methods that enable effective communication between humans and computers using natural languages. Research in this area involves the study of natural languages (the languages people use in their daily lives), closely related to linguistics but with significant differences. The main emphasis is on developing computer systems, especially software systems, that can effectively implement natural language communication. NLP finds applications in machine translation, sentiment analysis, automatic summarization, opinion extraction, text classification, question answering, semantic comparison of texts, speech recognition, Chinese OCR, and more.

Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP): In the field of neuro-linguistic programming, we will discuss how to organize one's mind to gain knowledge about the world or about humans interacting with each other. It explores how this knowledge is used and how it affects life. NLP is the science of the process by which human thought, language, and action connect with others and the objective world. NLP proposes many assumptions as premises, such as the "map is not the territory" hypothesis, including interpretations of other people's thought patterns and their uses. The central tenet of NLP is "imitation," originating from studying the reasons for the success of outstanding individuals and converting the results into skillful procedures based on imitating others and oneself. This discipline is internationally used in business, sales, sports, law, education, and other fields to help people coordinate inner conflicting selves, improve the quality of the mind, etc.

Natural Language Processing in AI: This term also refers to NLP being used as an umbrella term for natural language-related techniques within the field of AI. For example, ChatGPT is a type of natural language processing (NLP) technology, which is a large-scale pre-trained language model based on transformers developed by OpenAI. NLP models like GPT-3 have achieved leading results on multiple NLP tasks and are widely used in virtual assistants, customer service robots, intelligent dialogue, and other fields.
